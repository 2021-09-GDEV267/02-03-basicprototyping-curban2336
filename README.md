 ApplePicker, Mission Demolition and Prototype 1
 
Prototype 1 is a game similar to Space Invaders and Galaga. The objective is to battle the floating Boss bombdropper and avoid being hit by his bombs. Every time you defeat him, a
new wave is made where his health, speed, and bomb drop rate increases. The goal is to last as long as possible.
